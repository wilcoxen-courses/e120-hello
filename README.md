# Exercise: Hello World

### Summary

This exercise goes over the basics of writing text from Python scripts. It also
shows how scripts can create Markdown files, which can be convenient when
preparing nicely-formatted output.

### Instructions

1. Please create a new script called `hello1.py` that uses the print function
to write the string "Hello, World!" Once the script is working properly, commit
it to the repository.

1. Create a new script called `hello2_file.py` that does the following.
    1. Sets a string called `author` to your name;
    1. Opens a new file called `hello2_file.md` for writing;
    1. Uses the print command three times to write the following lines to the
    file: `# Hello, World!`, a blank line, and a line with "Author:" followed
    by a space and the `author` string surrounded by Markdown's italics
    notation.
    1. Closes the file.
    1. When `hello2_file.py` is working properly, it should produce output
    similar to `example.md`.

1. Commit the finished versions of `hello2_file.py` and `hello2_file.md` to
the repository.

### Submitting

Once you're happy with everything and have committed all of the changes to
your local repository, please push the changes to GitHub. At that point,
you're done: you have submitted your answer.
