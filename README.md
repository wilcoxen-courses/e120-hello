# Exercise: Hello World

### Summary

This exercise goes over the basics of writing text from Python scripts. It also
shows how scripts can create Markdown files, which can be convenient when
preparing nicely-formatted output files.

### Instructions

1. Please create a new script called `hello1.py` that uses the print function
to write the string "Hello, World!" Once the script is working properly, commit
it to the repository.

2. Create a new script called `hello2_file.py` that opens a new file called
`hello2_file.md` for writing, uses the print command three times to write the
three lines below to it, and then closes file.
  1. `# Hello, World!`
  1. A blank line
  1. A line with Author: followed by a space and then your name in Markdown's
  italics notation.

### Submitting

Once you're happy with everything and have committed all of the changes to
your local repository, please push the changes to GitHub. At that point,
you're done: you have submitted your answer.
